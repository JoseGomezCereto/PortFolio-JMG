Passionate about technologies and computers. <br> I love video games, reading, music... <br> Always learning, always improving. <br> <br>Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why."
